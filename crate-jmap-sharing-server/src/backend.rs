//! SharingBackend trait and supporting types for JMAP Sharing method handlers.
//!
//! Consumers implement [`SharingBackend`] for their storage system. The method
//! handlers in sibling modules call into the backend through this trait.
//!
//! The read-side operations (`get_objects`, `get_state`, `get_changes`,
//! `query_objects`, `query_changes`) are defined on the [`jmap_server::JmapBackend`]
//! supertrait. Only write operations are here.
//!
//! Marker traits and property selector enums live in `jmap-types` and
//! `jmap-sharing-types` respectively; they are re-exported here for convenience.
